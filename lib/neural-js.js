## Motivations
Motivations for this program is to first fulfill the requirements of Soft Computing,
a class offered at Montana State University.  The class is taught by http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jsquad/

The secondary motivation is to create an awesome piece of open-source neural network software
that can easily be used by any novice w/ basic understanding of neural networks.  The software is
to offer an easily customizable network with n hidden layers, back prop, ..., you name it! :)

// The neural network export
